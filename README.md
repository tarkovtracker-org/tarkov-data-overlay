# tarkov-data-overlay

Community-maintained data overlay for [tarkov.dev](https://tarkov.dev) API corrections and additions.

## Why?

The tarkov.dev API is an excellent resource, but game updates sometimes outpace data updates. This overlay provides:

- **Corrections**: Fix incorrect data (task levels, map requirements, etc.)
- **Additions**: New data types not in tarkov.dev (game editions, etc.)

## Usage

Fetch the overlay from jsDelivr CDN:

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tarkovtracker-org/tarkov-data-overlay@main/dist/overlay.json
```

Then merge it with tarkov.dev responses. See [Integration Guide](docs/INTEGRATION.md) for details.

## Current Additions

## Maintenance

The overlay is regularly validated against the tarkov.dev API to ensure corrections are still needed:

```bash
npm run check-overrides
```

This command compares all overrides against current API data and reports:
- ✅ Overrides that are still needed
- 🔄 Corrections that have been fixed upstream (can be removed)
- 🗑️  Tasks that have been removed from the API (can be deleted)

Run this periodically to keep the overlay lean and accurate.
